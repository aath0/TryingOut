	<p>I am a cognitive neuroscientist studying the neural mechanisms that allow us to perceive our environment. 
	I am particularly interested on how we extract regularities and statistical rules from sensory stimuli, according to our
		levels of <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn_a_00835?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed#.WRtlJxOGPOQ">attention</a>
		or <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/brain/awv041">awareness</a>. 
	</p>
	<p> To study neural functions of the human brain, I am using a variety of imaging <a href = "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/87565641.2011.636851">EEG</a>, MEG, ECoG, fMRI) and psychophysiological techniques (skin conductance,
		<a href = "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyp.12801/full">pupil size</a>, <a href = "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyp.12775/full">startle responses</a>), in combination with <a href = "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320311001440">machine learning</a> and modeling approaches. My goal is to characterise
		neural and computational mechanisms which allow typical individuals to perceive their environment and, ultimately, to
		examine how these are disrupted in patients with disorders of consciousness.</p>
	<p>Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Zurich, Switzerland and I am affiliated to the 
		<a href ="http://www.neuroscience.uzh.ch/en.html">Neuroscience Centre Zurich</a>. </p>
	<p>In paralel to my research activities I strive to promote diversity in academia and outreach education to gender, ethnic,
		sexual, or other minorities. To this aim, I have been teaching in summer schools for women in <a href = "https://www.ingenieurinnen-sommeruni.de/en/summer2017/index.php">engineering</a> and <a href = "https://www.informatica-feminale.de/eng/home-en/">informatics</a> at the 
		University of Bremen, Germany. </p>
