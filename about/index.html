	<h1>Athina Tzovara: About</h1>
	<p>I am a cognitive neuroscientist, studying the neural functions that allow us to perceive our environment. 
	I am particularly interested on how we extract regularities and statistical rules from environmental stimuli, according to our
		levels of attention or awareness. 
	</p>
	<p> I am using a variety of imaging (EEG/MEG/ECoG/fMRI) and psychophysiological techniques (Skin conductance,
		pupil size, and startle responses), combined with machine learning and statistical modeling approaches. My goal is to understand
		which neural and computational mechanisms allow typical individuals to perceive their environment and how these are altered in patients with disorders of consciousness.</p>
	<p>Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Zurich, in Switzerland. </p>
