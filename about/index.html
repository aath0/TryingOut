	<p>I am a cognitive neuroscientist, studying the neural functions that allow us to perceive our environment. 
	I am particularly interested on how we extract regularities and statistical rules from sensory stimuli, according to our
		levels of <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn_a_00835?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed#.WRtlJxOGPOQ">attention</a>
		or <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/brain/awv041">awareness</a>. 
	</p>
	<p> To assess neural functions I am using a variety of imaging (<a href = "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/87565641.2011.636851">EEG</a>, MEG, ECoG, fMRI) and psychophysiological techniques (skin conductance,
		pupil size, <a href = "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyp.12775/full">startle responses</a>), in combination with <a href = "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320311001440">machine learning</a> and modeling approaches. My goal is to identify
		neural and computational mechanisms which allow typical individuals to perceive their environment and 
		examine how those are disrupted in patients with disorders of consciousness.</p>
	<p>Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Zurich, in Switzerland. I am affiliated to the 
		<a href ="http://www.neuroscience.uzh.ch/en.html">Neuroscience Centre Zurich</a>. </p>
	<p>In paralel to my research activities I strive to promote diversity in academia and outreach education to gender, ethnic,
		cultural or sexual minorities. To this aim, I have been teaching in summer schools for women in <a href = "https://www.ingenieurinnen-sommeruni.de/en/summer2017/index.php">engineering</a> and <a href = "https://www.informatica-feminale.de/eng/home-en/">informatics</a> at the 
		University of Bremen, Germany.
