	<h1>Athina Tzovara: About</h1>
	<p>I am a cognitive neuroscientist, studying the neural functions that allows us to perceive regularities in our environment. 
		In particular, I am interested on how we extract regularities and statistical rules from environmental stimuli, at different levels of attention or awareness. 
	</p>
	<p> To study neurobiological mechanisms in humans I am using a variety of imaging (EEG/MEG/ECoG/fMRI), psychophysiological (Skin conductance,
		pupil size, and startle responses), combined with machine learning and statistical modeling techniques. My goal is to obtain a thorough understanding
		of environmental perception in typical individuals and patients with disorders of consciousness.</p>
	<p>Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Zurich, in Switzerland. </p>
