	<h1> These are some of the research questions that keep me busy: </h1>
	<p><em>How do we extract regularities from our environment?</p></em>
	<p>In our everyday lives we are constantly exposed to streams of sensory stimuli such as images, speech or music. 
	Most of the time, these do not occur in a random way but follow statistical rules and repetitive patterns. My goal is to 
		understand how we detect such rules and construct models of our environment. 		
	</p>

<p><em>How is our perception influenced by attention or awareness?</em></p>
<p>	Perception of our environment may occur explicitly, as for example when we try to learn a new song, or implicitly, when for example
		we recognise a song while our attention is diverted to other tasks. I am interested in studying which brain functions enable learning
		as a function of attention or awareness.
	</p>

<p><em>Which neural functions are preserved in coma?</em></p>
<p>	Patients who are in a coma are often not aware of their environment. Detecting neural functions which remain intact despite a deeply
	unconscious state has been the main goal of my PhD.
	</p>
	
	<h1> And these are some of the techniques that I'm using to answer them: </h1>
	<p><em>
		Electrophysiological recordings (EEG / iEEG)</em></p>
	<p><em>Behavioral models</em></p>
