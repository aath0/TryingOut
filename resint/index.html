	<h2> These are some of the research questions that keep me busy: </h2>
	<p><em>How do we extract regularities from our environment?</em> ...</p>
 	<p><em>How is our perception influenced by consciousness?</em> ...</p>
	<h2> And these are techniques that I'm using to answer them: </h2>
	<p><em>Electrophysiological recordings (EEG / iEEG)</em> ...</p>
	<p><em>Behavioral modeling</em> ...</p>
	<p><em>Modeling of psychophysiological responses</em> ...</p>
	<p><em>Machine learning techniques</em> ...</p>
